            In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service related to
            Incridea 2023, held by NMAM Institute of Technology, is determined
            to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall

            applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be
            severed from these Terms of Service. Such determination shall not

            Terms of Service, they may terminate this agreement at any time
            without notice, and the party at fault will remain liable for all
            amounts due up to and including the date of termination. The party
            terminating the agreement may also deny the other party access to
            their services or any part thereof.
